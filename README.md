# MediVision Pneumonia Detector 🩺

An AI-powered backend service for detecting **pneumonia from chest X-ray images** using deep learning.

🔍 Overview
This project uses EfficientNetB0, trained on chest X-ray datasets, to classify whether a patient is likely to have pneumonia. The model is served via a **FastAPI backend**, making it accessible for integration with web or mobile frontends.

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ Deep Learning Model: **EfficientNetB0**
- ✅ Loss Function: **Cross Entropy Loss**
- ✅ **Class Balancing** to address dataset imbalance
- ✅ REST API with **FastAPI** for easy deployment
- ✅ Ready for integration with any frontend (React, Flutter, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Model**: EfficientNetB0 (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## 📈 Status
🚧 **In Progress** – Model trained and API functional, frontend development will follow.
